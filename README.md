# Deprication Warning

I have started on a new version of this framework which is much lighter weight and easier to use. This code is about four years old, and while it works fine follows old development paradigms.

Please try out [**Foundation Light !**](https://github.com/NVentimiglia/Foundation-Light)


# Unity3d-Foundation

This is a starter framework with common application services for building quality data driven games.
